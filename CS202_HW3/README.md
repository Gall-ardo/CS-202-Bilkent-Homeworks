# Homework 3: Hashing

## Description
This is the CS 202 HW 3 assignment for Bilkent University, which includes four programs:

1. **substrings.cpp**: Uses hashing to efficiently find all occurrences of multiple patterns within a text. Implements rolling hash and achieves optimal performance for pattern matching tasks.

2. **minimalset.cpp**: Determines the minimal subset of strings using hashing, allowing reverse and cyclic shift operations while minimizing reverse operations.

4. **lexicographic.cpp**: Finds the lexicographically smallest insertion order for elements into a hash table implemented with linear probing.

5. **insertionorders.cpp**: Calculates the number of possible insertion orders for elements producing a given hash table, using modular arithmetic to handle large results.
