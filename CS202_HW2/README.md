# Homework 2: Heap and AVL Trees

## Description
This is the CS 202 HW 2 assignment for Bilkent University, which includes four programs:

1. **least5.cpp**:
   Implements a min-heap to handle adding elements, removing the top, and querying the least 5 elements without removal.

2. **game.cpp**:
   Simulates a card game where two players, Bob√¥ and Holosko, pick cards from their decks to maximize points. The program calculates the final score using optimal strategies with O(N * log N) efficiency.

3. **prefixsubarray.cpp**:
   Finds the minimum subarray length \( L \) where a permuted array `A[1:L]` has at least `M` indices greater than `B[1:L]`. The solution runs in  O(N * log N * log M)  time.

4. **subarray.cpp**:
   Finds the smallest subarray where `M` elements from the first array `A` are greater than `K` elements from the second array `B`. The program efficiently determines this subarray within O(N * log N) time.
