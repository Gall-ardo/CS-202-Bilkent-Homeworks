# Homework 1: Binary Search Trees

## Overview
This assignment involves implementing and analyzing pointer-based binary search trees (BSTs). The goal is to understand the properties and operations of BSTs and analyze their performance under various scenarios.

## Objectives
Tree Traversals: Analyze sequences for pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
Tree Construction: Understand and implement BST insertion logic based on specific conditions.
Implement BST Operations:
Insert keys
Delete keys
In-order traversal
Find maximum full binary tree level
Lowest common ancestor
Maximum sum path
Maximum width
Path between two nodes
